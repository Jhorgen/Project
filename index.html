<h2 class="aboutme1"><em>About me</em></h2>
<p class="aboutme2">My name is Josh. I was born in Oregon and raised in the Clackamas area. Since graduating high school in 2010; I've worked, studied, and planned for my future. It took me a while to decide what to formally study, but I knew that I wanted to learn something that could apply to business. Since late 2017 I have studied basic programing fundamentals such as: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I decided on Computer Science as my focus of study because of it's application in business and life in general.

Taking this route hasn't been easy due to the time consuming nature of programming. Until recently my learning has been through free online resources. In May 2019, I began attending a Portland Coding school called Epicodus with the intention of becoming a software developer. In the meantime, I buy and sell cars under a dealers license and deliver food when I have the time.

I also attend Portland Community College and plan to complete my associates degree within the next two years. From there, I plan on transfering to complete my undergrad part-time.

Outside of that, I have lots of hobbies and interests that keep me busy and entertained. </p>
